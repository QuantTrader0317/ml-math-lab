# 🧠 Machine Learning Math Lab — 5 Core Projects in Python (Built from Scratch)

### 🚀 Overview
This project is my hands-on lab for mastering the **mathematical foundations of machine learning** using pure Python (v3.13) and NumPy.

Everything here was written, debugged, and explained line by line inside **PyCharm**, to fully understand *how* the math behind each model actually works — not just how to call it from a library.

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to **translate math formulas into working code**  
- Why each algorithm converges (or fails)  
- The difference between **exact math** and **numerical stability**  
- How modern libraries like scikit-learn are built under the hood  

---

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- **Python 3.13**
- **NumPy 2.1+**
- **scikit-learn** (for cross-verification)
- **PyCharm** (for daily environment setup, debugging, and testing)

---

## 🧩 Example Insights
- **Power Iteration:** the matrix naturally “pulls” vectors toward its strongest direction  
- **OLS Regression:** the math behind line-fitting is just solving `XᵀXβ = Xᵀy`  
- **Logistic Regression:** prediction is probability, not just classification  
- **k-Means:** unsupervised patterns form through repeated nearest-center assignments  
- **PCA:** you can compress data without losing most of its meaning

## 🏁 Key Takeaway
> “If you can code the math from scratch, you can understand any ML model — no black boxes.”

This repo built my foundation for deeper research in **quantitative finance, econometrics, and machine learning**.

## 📸 Optional Demo Post
> Just finished building 5 core ML algorithms completely from scratch in Python.  
> No high-level wrappers, no shortcuts — just math, NumPy, and logic.  
> The goal wasn’t just to get the right answer, but to *understand* why it’s right.  
>
> 🧮 Power Iteration → Eigenvalues  
> 📈 OLS Regression → Linear Models  
> 🔁 Logistic Regression → Optimization  
> 🎯 k-Means → Clustering  
> 🔍 PCA → Dimensionality Reduction  
>
> All coded and explained inside PyCharm using Python 3.13.  
> This is how you turn theory into intuition.
